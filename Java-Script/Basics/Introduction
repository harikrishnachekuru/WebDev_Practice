Scripting VS programming 

-> Which are compiled are called programing language.
-> which are enterpreted are called scripting language.

DOM (Document Object Model)
It creates a tree form/reads the code by structure as <html><head></head><body></body></html>
We can only see code not a structure how it reads.

DOM MANIPULATION :
-> It can change everything/manipulate the things from client side.

Variable :
A temparary Memory location where we store the data.
We just assign value to variable and that will be stored.
ex : a = 2;

data types :
var - variant 







String.Includes -> Here it matches the stored variable and gets/verifies the availablity of the string.
ex: 
var s= "HackerRank";
// Here it verify the string with availability of charecter or string data.
console.log(s.includes("hack")+ " " + s.includes("Hack"));  
//Output of above is false true
//The below get the false true
//As which it is comparing the quotations as well
console.log(s.includes() + " " + s.includes(""));
