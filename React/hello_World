Simple ways of implementing showcasing hello world in the browser is 

-> First we can directly inside of the root folder 

-> the second way is making a part of index.js as well
        -> ReactDom.render( <h1>Hello World</h1> ,
        document.getElementById( "root" ));

        -> Here in the render part the process how its working is 
            -> ReactDom.render( "What do you want to" , "Where do you want to" , "Callback function")
-> we can also make this as making a saperate component.
    -> In the component we just include all the needed part to be implemented in the code below
     -> call the same as function in the render function as supposed to combine within the same component
