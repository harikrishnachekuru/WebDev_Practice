Why should we import react in every component is 
 -> If you are using the Jsx elements so, we should import react in your component.
 -> If you wont import react in your component then you get an error As
  "React must be scope when you are using the Jsx"

***
In Ecma_script-5 we use  to create variable and using 
 -> Var , let  
    it is for importing the variable in the react application

In Ecma_script-6 we use importing the variable as 
 -> using import __ from " ";

***
Jsx means JavaScript Xml
 -> In here the code the jsx refers to the code that to represented which is used inside the render function
  As format of Html.
 -> for example: 
        ReactDOM.render(
            <h1>Hello</h1> ("here it is an Html element that which refers as jsx element in reactjs")
            );

***
in the babel how it works
-> ReactDom.render( React.createElement("h1", null, "Hello world"),
                    document.getElementById("root"));

***
In pure javascript
-> var h2 = document.createElement("h2");
    h2.innerHTML = "Hello world";
    document.getElementById("root").appendChild(h2);
you to connect with the root element


***
We need definetely use <ReactRender></ReactRender>
